		<p>Hello, I am a hobbyist Photographer from St. Louis, MO. I mainly specialize in outdoor photography, especially nature and wildlife photography.
			I usually take my camera with me on trips, vacations, and for events; you can usually find me with it on most travels.
		</p>
		<p>All photographs were shot with either a Canon 7d Mark II or Canon T5i, and most editing done with Adobe Photoshop. Feel free to take a look at each category and contact me 
			if you have any questions/queries. Enjoy!
